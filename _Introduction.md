# Artificial Intelligence

### Introduction
Rapid evolving field of engineering, with an ultimate objective to build machines capable of acting and thinking like humans.  

AI involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence, and applying them as algorithms in a computer

The term was AI coined by John McCarthy in 1956.

**INTELLIGENCE ?**  
Ability to reason, trigger new thoughts, perceive, learn, acquire, understand, analyze, apply knowledge.

## Goals of AI
* Replicate human intelligence
* Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks
* An intelligent connection of perception & action
* Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence

## History
In 1950, Alan Turing - "Can machine think?"
    
Human interrogator on one side of wall & on other side -  
A machine & A human  
If an interrogator would not be able to identify which is a machine and which is human => Intelligent Machine


## Problems
1. Early focus on AI -  
was on games, thought only sol is to explore.
2. Commonsense Reasoning
3. Advancement in AI
4. Challenege in Perception
5. Challeneges in Natural langugage understanding

## Brain vs AI
| Aspect            | Human Brain                                  | Artificial Intelligence (AI)                |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Nature**       | Biological (organic)         | Digital (machine-based)       |
| **Processing Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Learning Method** | Learns from experience and emotions | Learns from data and algorithms |
| **Creativity**    | Highly creative and intuitive | Limited creativity, follows patterns |
| **Decision Making** | Uses reasoning, emotions, and intuition | Uses logic, patterns, and data |
| **Adaptability**  | Adapts quickly to new situations | Requires retraining for major changes |
| **Error Handling** | Can recognize and correct mistakes | Needs explicit programming to correct errors |
