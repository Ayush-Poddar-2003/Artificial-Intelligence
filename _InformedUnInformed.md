| **Definition**   | Uses additional information (heuristics) to find the best path. | Searches blindly without extra knowledge. |
| **Efficiency**   | More efficient as it guides the search.         | Less efficient, explores all possible paths. |
| **Examples**     | A* Algorithm, Best-First Search, Hill Climbing  | BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search) |
| **Memory Usage** | Generally requires more memory for heuristics.  | Uses less memory but may take longer. |
| **Performance**  | Faster in large search spaces due to heuristics. | Slower as it explores blindly. |
| **Best Use Case** | When a heuristic function is available. | When no prior knowledge is available. |
